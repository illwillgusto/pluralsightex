/*
Unit Testing
where individual components ("units") of an application are tested to make sure
they behave as the author intended.
These tests are usually written for a specific unit testing framework.
It is common for these tests to get executed every time code is committed to a
project to ensure the new code does not break application functionality.

-unit testing is just one type of testing that complex software projects may leverage

Code Coverage
a metric designed to tell you how much of an application is actually tested
by the collection of unit tests that have been written for it.
While there are different approaches for calculating this metric, it is generally
assumed that a higher code coverage number is better than a lower one
as it means more of the application is tested by the unit tests. */

/*
Unit Testing
where individual components ("units") of an application are tested to make sure
they behave as the author intended.
These tests are usually written for a specific unit testing framework.
It is common for these tests to get executed every time code is committed to a
project to ensure the new code does not break application functionality.

-unit testing is just one type of testing that complex software projects may leverage
